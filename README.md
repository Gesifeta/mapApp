# About the project
The map app solves two problems:
Firtst, it locates current position of the user from any places.
Then, it enables users to go to random places and the come back to its original position
The app starts the default location of the user. The user can also go to any random location and the return back to the default location.
# The the app relied on Google Map API libraries and frameworks.
