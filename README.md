# About the project
The map app solves two problems:
Firtst, it locates current position of the user from any places.
Then, it enables users to go to random places and the come back to its original position
The app starts from the default location of the user. Then the user can  go to any random location and  return back to the default location.
# The the app relied on Google Map API libraries and frameworks.
